Hello 

Your personalized state machine description for Lab 4 (coe 428) follows:

A G B
B E H
C B A
D H G
E D C
F C E
G F G
H A D

Your starting state is: G 

   Good luck!

Process:
I was able to implement three commands except the garbage, deleted and I attempted the changing 
command as well but it wasn't working well for me. However I do keep getting segmentation errors when
I test my code and I'm not sure at all why. First of all the main thing I had to search for
was how to use structures and implement them. So I defined a structure data type and introduce my variables. 
Next I made a new function called intial state and what this function does is that an array will intiated and will 
correspond to a state letter which has been stated and once 0 is inputted it will add up to the letter and this will be the 
same when input = 1. The print function will print out the state machine. With the main I initially made an array to make different
commands for different functions. In order to take the inputs a while loop is created. Next I tried to implement the change command but 
I tried testing it and it was not working so I commented it out. I started working on the garbage command but was not able to successfully implement it.
My hope with the garbage program was to implement a command that would create an array and search all the states for values which are unreachable using if 
statements and another pair of if statements to see whether or not the there is a garbage or not. I quickly realized that in order to have the delete command
working, I would need to get the garbage command to work which was difficult to do for me. 

Overall this lab was extremely difficult for me to follow and understand. I tried my best to implement as much as I could and used the internet to gather 
some information about the functionality of the code. I hope future labs are bit less complex :).
